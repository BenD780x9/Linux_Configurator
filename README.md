# EZLinux - Linux_Configurator

# To Do:
  1. Start testing. (dnf in progress | Ubuntu broken because QT5)
  2. Add all software to the installer (some in dnf\apt not listed in installer but they are in the window)
  3. Add more Distro's to run.sh
  4. How we want to ship the app? AppImage / Bash (That pull from the git)/ Flatpak or others...
  
  **After That we can release the first version.**
